# Experiment: Babashka Pod Deployment to Clojars

**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Researcher**: Observer  

## Objective

Research and document the process for deploying Babashka pods to Clojars, including:
- Pod vs library nomenclature and conventions
- Clojars deployment process for pods
- Usage patterns and discoverability
- Version management and compatibility

## Background

Babashka pods are a unique deployment artifact that differs from standard Clojure libraries:
- **Pods**: Native binaries with Babashka-specific APIs
- **Libraries**: Pure Clojure code compatible with both Babashka and JVM
- **Mixed**: Libraries with optional pod components for performance

## Research Questions

1. **Nomenclature**: What naming conventions exist for pods vs libraries on Clojars?
2. **Deployment**: How do you deploy a pod to Clojars? What metadata is required?
3. **Discovery**: How do users find and evaluate pods vs regular libraries?
4. **Usage**: What does pod consumption look like in `bb.edn` and code?
5. **Versioning**: How do pod versions relate to library versions?
6. **Registry**: How does the pod registry interact with Clojars?

## Pod Nomenclature Investigation

### Convention Patterns
- `org.babashka/pod-*` - Official Babashka pods
- `com.company/pod-*` - Third-party pods
- `io.github.user/pod-*` - Personal pods
- Suffix patterns: `-pod`, `.pod`, or prefix `pod-`

### Examples to Research
- `babashka/pod-babashka-curl`
- `babashka/pod-babashka-sqlite3`
- `babashka/pod-babashka-postgresql`
- `babashka/pod-babashka-aws`

## Clojars Deployment Process

### Required Artifacts
- [ ] JAR with pod manifest
- [ ] Native binaries (per platform)
- [ ] POM with correct metadata
- [ ] Documentation and examples

### Metadata Requirements
- [ ] Pod-specific classifiers
- [ ] Platform-specific artifacts
- [ ] Babashka version compatibility
- [ ] Native dependencies listed

## Usage Analysis

### In bb.edn
```clojure
{:pods {org.babashka/pod-babashka-curl {:version "0.1.2"}}}
```

### In Code
```clojure
(require '[babashka.pods :as pods])
(pods/load-pod 'org.babashka/pod-babashka-curl)
(require '[pod.babashka.curl :as curl])
```

## Experimental Design

### Phase 1: Survey Existing Pods
- Catalog existing pods on Clojars
- Document naming conventions
- Analyze deployment metadata
- Map pod registry to Clojars entries

### Phase 2: Create Minimal Pod
- Develop simple pod (e.g., pod-babashka-echo)  
- Write pod manifest and native component
- Test local loading and functionality

### Phase 3: Clojars Deployment
- Set up Clojars account and GPG keys
- Deploy pod following discovered conventions
- Document the deployment process
- Test installation from Clojars

### Phase 4: Usage Documentation
- Create pod usage examples
- Document version compatibility
- Test cross-platform deployment
- Measure performance vs pure Clojure

## Expected Artifacts

- [ ] Pod naming convention guide
- [ ] Clojars deployment checklist
- [ ] Working example pod on Clojars
- [ ] Usage documentation and examples
- [ ] Platform compatibility matrix
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria

1. Working pod deployed to Clojars
2. Documentation of complete deployment process
3. Usage examples for consumers
4. Performance analysis vs alternatives
5. Integration with existing tooling

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Support
- Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Windows (x86_64)
- Potentially: FreeBSD, other Unix variants

### Dependency Management
- Native library packaging
- Version compatibility matrices
- Breaking changes documentation
- Migration guides between versions

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Survey and analysis of existing pods
- **Week 2**: Minimal pod development and testing
- **Week 3**: Clojars deployment and documentation
- **Week 4**: Usage examples and performance testing

- [Release Management and Versioning](./babashka-release-management.md)

## Risk Assessment

- **High**: Native compilation complexity across platforms
- **Medium**: Clojars metadata requirements for pods
- **Low**: Basic pod functionality and loading
