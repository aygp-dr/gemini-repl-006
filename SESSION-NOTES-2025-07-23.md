# Session Notes for TRUE-OBSERVER - 2025-07-23

## Session Summary
Extended debugging and documentation session on the jwalsh-student-dryrun branch, followed by cleanup and documentation updates on main.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. JSON Investigation (Experiment 004)
- Discovered Cheshire is built into Babashka v1.12.206
- Proved JSON parsing works correctly
- Response display issue is NOT JSON-related

### 2. Debug Infrastructure (Experiment 013)
- Added comprehensive debug logging to api_client.clj and repl.clj
- Created .env.debug and debug-repl.sh for troubleshooting
- Confirmed logging infrastructure works

### 3. CLI Implementation
- Created dedicated cli.clj module
- Implemented argument parsing for -h, -v, -p flags
- Discovered Makefile doesn't forward args (noted in issues)

### 4. Prompt System (Experiment 003)
- Implemented 8 configurable prompt styles
- Added /prompt command for runtime switching
- Created comprehensive tests

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Created STATUS.md with project overview
- Updated README.org to explain three-document structure
- Added REQUIREMENTS.org (ready for Observer enhancement)
- CRITICAL: Updated .gitignore to ensure .env files are NEVER tracked

## Outstanding Issues

### Critical for v0.1.0
1. **Response Display (#19)** - API responses not showing, only metadata
   - Debug logging added but root cause not found
   - Not a JSON parsing issue
   - Likely in response handling flow

2. **Print Mode (#18)** - Not implemented yet
   - CLI parsing ready
   - Needs API integration

3. **Test Infrastructure (#21)** - Namespace mismatches
   - Fixed test runner syntax
   - Individual test files need namespace corrections

## Technical Discoveries

1. **Babashka Includes**:
   - Cheshire for JSON (not babashka.json)
   - HTTP client works well
   - No readline support built-in

2. **Platform Limitations**:
   - GraalVM native-image doesn't work on FreeBSD
   - Babashka script mode works perfectly

3. **Architecture Insights**:
   - Clean separation of concerns working well
   - Tool system framework in place
   - Context management functional

## Recommendations for Observer

1. **REQUIREMENTS.org Enhancement**:
   - Current version is comprehensive but could use Observer's architectural insights
   - Consider adding more specific test scenarios
   - Security requirements might need hardening

2. **Response Display Issue**:
   - This is THE blocker for v0.1.0
   - Debug logging is in place to help trace
   - Might benefit from Observer's debugging expertise

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Need clear path to fix namespace issues
   - Property-based testing for security boundaries
   - Integration test coverage for API calls

## Git Branch Status
- **main**: Clean, all changes committed and pushed
- **jwalsh-student-dryrun**: Feature branch with all experiments (not merged)

## Files of Interest
- src/gemini_repl/core/api_client.clj - Has debug logging for response parsing
- src/gemini_repl/core/repl.clj - Display logic with flush calls
- experiments/004-babashka-json-investigation/ - Proves JSON works
- STATUS.md - Comprehensive project overview

## User Feedback Highlights
- "no, it's a completely new test, not a repl improvement" - Clear about experiment organization
- "deep dive https://book.babashka.org/#libraries" - Led to Cheshire discovery
- "good point. make a note in the gh issue" - About Makefile limitations
- "scared me half to death yo :D" - When ensuring .env security

The user was patient and provided good direction throughout the debugging session. The project is well-organized with clear separation between educational materials (main) and implementation (branches).
