* Overview

This repository contains a *literate programming exercise* designed for students learning to work with AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini) in software development workflows.

The repository does *NOT* contain a working REPL - instead, it provides a comprehensive specification in the form of a literate org-mode document that an AI assistant can use to generate a complete, working implementation.

* Learning Objectives

Students who complete this exercise will learn:

1. *Literate Programming*: How to work with org-mode documents that combine code and documentation
2. *AI-Assisted Development*: How to guide AI assistants to generate working code from specifications
3. *Functional Programming*: Clojure/Babashka idioms and patterns
4. *System Architecture*: Building a non-trivial application with multiple components
5. *Tool Integration*: Working with external APIs, file systems, and command-line interfaces

* What's in This Repository

This repository contains exactly two files:

1. [[file:README.org][README.org]] (this file) - Instructions for students
2. [[file:CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org][CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org]] - A complete literate programming specification

The [[file:CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org][=CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org=]] file contains:
- Detailed system architecture
- All source code (embedded in org-mode blocks)
- Configuration files
- Build scripts
- Test suites
- Documentation
- AI assistant guidance

* Getting Started

** Prerequisites

- An AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with command-line tools
- Emacs with org-mode (for tangling) OR an AI that can extract code blocks
- Babashka installed (for running the generated code)
  - FreeBSD users: See [[https://github.com/babashka/babashka/releases][Babashka releases]] and [[https://github.com/babashka/freebsd-compat-test][FreeBSD compatibility notes]]
  - Other systems: Follow [[https://babashka.org/#installation][official installation guide]]

** Exercise Steps

1. *Fork or Clone* this repository:
   #+begin_src bash
   git clone https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl-006.git
   cd gemini-repl-006
   #+end_src

2. *Read* the [[file:CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org][=CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org=]] file to understand the system design

3. *Use your AI assistant* to:
   - Extract (tangle) all the code from the org file
   - Set up the project structure
   - Configure the environment
   - Run tests
   - Start the REPL

4. *Document* your process:
   - What prompts worked well?
   - What challenges did you encounter?
   - How did you guide the AI to success?

** Example AI Prompts

Here are some prompts to get you started:

#+begin_example
"I have a literate programming document called [[file:CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org][CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org]] that contains 
embedded source code for a Clojure/Babashka project. Can you help me extract all the 
code files and set up the project?"
#+end_example

#+begin_example
"Please analyze the [[file:CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org][CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org]] file and create a Makefile target that 
will tangle all the source code files to their correct locations."
#+end_example

#+begin_example
"The org file contains some documentation inconsistencies that were intentionally 
left for educational purposes. Can you identify and fix them?"
#+end_example

* Learning Path

** Beginner Level
1. Successfully extract all files from the org document
2. Get the basic REPL running
3. Execute simple commands

** Intermediate Level
1. Fix any inconsistencies in the extracted code
2. Add a new slash command to the REPL
3. Implement a new tool function
4. Write additional tests

** Advanced Level
1. Refactor the code to improve architecture
2. Add new features (e.g., conversation branching)
3. Implement alternative backends (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
4. Create your own literate programming document for a different project

* Evaluation Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated on:

1. *Successful Extraction*: Did you extract all files correctly?
2. *Working Implementation*: Does the REPL run without errors?
3. *Problem Solving*: How did you handle issues and inconsistencies?
4. *AI Collaboration*: How effectively did you work with your AI assistant?
5. *Documentation*: Did you document your process and learnings?

* Tips for Success

- Start by understanding the overall architecture before diving into details
- Use the AI to explain parts you don't understand
- Test incrementally - don't try to get everything working at once
- The org file has intentional inconsistencies - fixing them is part of the exercise
- Compare your extracted files with the expected structure described in the org file

* Submission

If this is part of a course:

1. Create a new repository with your working implementation
2. Include a =LEARNING-JOURNAL.org= documenting:
   - Your process
   - AI prompts that worked well
   - Challenges and solutions
   - Insights about AI-assisted development
3. Submit a pull request with a link to your repository

* Historical Context

This is version 006 in the gemini-repl series:
- [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl][Original]]: ClojureScript implementation
- [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl-001][001]]: Added formal methods (TLA+, Alloy)
- [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl-003][003]]: Enhanced tooling and CI/CD
- [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl-005][005]]: Python port with literate programming
- [[https://github.com/aygp-dr/gemini-repl-006][006]]: Clojure/Babashka with literate programming (this exercise)

Each version explores different aspects of REPL design and implementation.

* Support

If you're stuck:
1. Re-read the relevant section of the org file
2. Ask your AI assistant to explain the architecture
3. Check if your issue is mentioned in the "Common Issues" section of the org file
4. Remember: the goal is to learn AI-assisted development, not just to get the code working

Good luck with your literate programming journey! ðŸš€
