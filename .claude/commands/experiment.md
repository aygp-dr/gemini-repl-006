# Experiment Command

Framework for experimental features in Gemini REPL.

## Experiment Structure

Create experiments in a separate namespace:
```clojure
(ns gemini-repl.experiments.feature-name
  "Experimental implementation of feature-name")
```

## Documentation Requirements

Each experiment should include:
1. **Hypothesis**: What we're testing
2. **Approach**: How we're implementing it
3. **Success Criteria**: How we measure success
4. **Results**: What we learned

## Integration Path

1. Prototype in experiments namespace
2. Test thoroughly
3. Get feedback
4. Refactor for production
5. Integrate into main codebase

## Current Experiments

- Alternative context management strategies
- Plugin system for tools
- Multiple AI provider support
- Advanced prompt engineering
