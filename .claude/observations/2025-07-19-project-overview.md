# Observation: 2025-07-19 - Project Overview

## Summary
gemini-repl-006 is an educational literate programming exercise designed to teach students how to work with AI assistants in software development. The project provides specifications for building a Clojure/Babashka REPL that integrates with Google's Gemini API.

## Details

### Project Structure
- **Primary language**: Clojure/Babashka
- **Documentation format**: Org-mode (literate programming)
- **Target audience**: Students learning AI-assisted development
- **Repository type**: Educational template/exercise

### Key Components
1. **README.org** - Student instructions and learning objectives
2. **CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org** - Complete literate programming specification
3. **PRODUCTION-READINESS-ISSUES.org** - Future deployment considerations
4. **babashka-1.12.206-standalone.jar** - Runtime dependency (should be in .gitignore)

### Architecture Patterns
- Literate programming approach combining documentation and code
- Designed for code extraction (tangling) from org-mode documents
- Focus on AI-assistant interaction patterns
- TUI-based REPL with potential self-modification capabilities

### Educational Focus
- Teaching literate programming concepts
- AI prompt engineering skills
- Functional programming patterns
- System architecture design
- Tool integration techniques

## Interesting Approaches
1. **Learning-by-extraction**: Students must use AI to extract working code from specifications
2. **Intentional inconsistencies**: Documentation contains deliberate issues for students to identify
3. **Progressive difficulty**: Beginner to advanced learning paths outlined
4. **Real-world considerations**: Production deployment patterns documented despite educational nature

## Technical Debt Indicators
- Large JAR file (23MB) committed to repository
- Missing actual source code files (by design - educational exercise)
- No tests visible yet (presumably in the org file)
- No CI/CD configuration

## Recommendations
1. **Version control**: The babashka JAR should not be tracked in git
2. **Documentation**: Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md for students
3. **Examples**: Could benefit from example solutions or student showcases
4. **Automation**: GitHub Actions for validating extracted code could enhance learning

## Questions for Development Team
1. How do students typically validate their extracted implementations?
2. Are there reference implementations available for instructors?
3. What's the expected completion time for different skill levels?
4. How does this fit into a larger curriculum?

## Security Considerations
- REPL with self-modification capabilities requires careful sandboxing
- API key management needs clear documentation for students
- Container isolation patterns well-documented in PRODUCTION-READINESS-ISSUES.org

## Next Analysis Steps
- Deep dive into CLOJURE-GEMINI-REPL.org to understand full specification
- Identify all code blocks and their intended extraction paths
- Map out the complete system architecture from the literate document
- Document the learning progression embedded in the exercise
