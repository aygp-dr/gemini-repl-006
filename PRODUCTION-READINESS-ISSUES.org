title: Implement Production Deployment Patterns for Gemini REPL
labels: enhancement, infrastructure, security
milestone: v1.0-production
---

## Overview

The Gemini REPL requires production-ready deployment patterns to ensure safe operation in multi-user environments. As a TUI-based REPL with potential for self-modification capabilities, we need robust isolation and deployment strategies.

## Requirements

### 1. Container-Based Isolation
- [ ] Create Dockerfile with minimal attack surface
- [ ] Implement user namespace isolation
- [ ] Configure resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- [ ] Disable network access except for Gemini API calls
- [ ] Mount filesystem as read-only where possible

### 2. Deployment Architecture
- [ ] Design multi-tier deployment (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Create health check endpoints for container orchestration
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

### 3. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Externalize all configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Implement secrets management for API keys
- [ ] Create .env.example with all required variables
- [ ] Document production environment requirements

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging (JSON format)
- [ ] Implement metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- [ ] Create alerts for anomalous behavior
- [ ] Track API usage and rate limits

## Acceptance Criteria
- REPL runs in isolated container with limited privileges
- Zero-downtime deployments are possible
- All secrets are externalized and encrypted at rest
- Monitoring dashboards show system health

## Security Considerations
- Container escape prevention
- API key rotation strategy
- Audit logging for all REPL commands
- Network egress restrictions

title: Implement Comprehensive Security Scanning for TUI REPL
labels: security, ci/cd, high-priority
milestone: v0.9-security
assignees: 
---

## Overview

A TUI REPL that can execute code and potentially self-modify presents unique security challenges. We need automated security scanning at multiple levels to prevent command injection, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

## Requirements

### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- [ ] Integrate semgrep for ClojureScript code analysis
- [ ] Configure custom rules for REPL-specific vulnerabilities
- [ ] Scan for command injection patterns
- [ ] Check for unsafe evaluation of user input

### 2. Dependency Scanning
- [ ] Implement npm audit in CI pipeline
- [ ] Add OWASP dependency check for JVM dependencies
- [ ] Configure Dependabot for automated updates
- [ ] Create policy for handling critical vulnerabilities

### 3. Container Scanning
- [ ] Integrate Trivy for container image scanning
- [ ] Scan base images before build
- [ ] Implement policy enforcement (fail on HIGH/CRITICAL)
- [ ] Regular scanning of deployed images

### 4. Runtime Security
- [ ] Implement input sanitization for REPL commands
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Create allowlist for safe Clojure functions
- [ ] Implement sandboxing for code execution

### 5. Security Testing
- [ ] Create security-focused test suite
- [ ] Test for injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify sandbox escape prevention
- [ ] Automate penetration testing scenarios

## Implementation Plan

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scanning
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  sast:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Semgrep
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
      
  dependency-check:
    # npm audit, OWASP checks
    
  container-scan:
    # Trivy scanning
```

## Success Metrics
- Zero HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities in production
- < 5 minute feedback loop for security issues
- 100% of dependencies scanned
- Security tests pass on every commit

## Special Considerations for REPL
- Prevent execution of system commands
- Sanitize ANSI escape sequences
- Validate all Gemini API responses
- Implement command history encryption

title: Build Structured CI/CD Pipeline for Gemini REPL Development
labels: infrastructure, automation, devops
milestone: v0.8-automation
---

## Overview

Establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that supports the unique requirements of a self-aware REPL system, including automated testing of meta-programming capabilities and safe deployment of self-modifying code.

## Requirements

### 1. Build Pipeline
- [ ] Multi-stage build process (dev/test/prod artifacts)
- [ ] Cache management for ClojureScript dependencies
- [ ] Artifact signing and verification
- [ ] Build reproducibility guarantees

### 2. Test Automation
- [ ] Unit tests for core REPL functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with Gemini API mocks
- [ ] TUI interaction tests (using expect/tmux)
- [ ] Self-modification safety tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### 3. Quality Gates
- [ ] Code coverage threshold (>80%)
- [ ] Linting (clj-kondo) with zero warnings
- [ ] Security scan must pass
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Documentation generation and validation

### 4. Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Automated staging deployments on main branch
- [ ] Manual approval gate for production
- [ ] Canary deployment support
- [ ] Automated rollback on health check failure
- [ ] Post-deployment verification tests

### 5. Observer Integration
- [ ] Automated observer report generation
- [ ] Claude Code analysis integration
- [ ] Metrics collection for AI-assisted development patterns
- [ ] Feedback loop for pipeline optimization

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml          # Main CI pipeline
├── security.yml    # Security scanning
├── deploy.yml      # Deployment pipeline
├── observer.yml    # Observer integration
└── nightly.yml     # Nightly builds/tests
```

### Key Features
- Matrix builds for multiple Clojure/Node versions
- Parallel test execution
- Artifact caching strategy
- Secrets rotation automation
- Deployment environment protection rules

## Success Criteria
- < 10 minute build + test cycle
- Zero manual deployment steps
- 100% automated rollback capability
- Full audit trail for all deployments
- Observer reports on every deployment

## Special Considerations
- Handle REPL's potential to modify its own CI/CD pipeline
- Ensure observer agents can analyze pipeline performance
- Create feedback mechanism for AI-suggested improvements
- Implement safeguards against recursive CI triggers
